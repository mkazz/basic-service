#Basic Framework for PHP Microservices###Description##This code is an experiment in self education. I was attempting to make a lightweight composable PHP frameworkfor RESTful microservices. It uses Sliex under the hood. I was inspired by the lack of structure and convention surrounding Sliex (at the time). There were too many terrible examples in the wild, this is my attempt to buildsomething clean and not as bloated as Symfony. Please keep in mind, this was a side project and is very much awork in progress.##License##This software is Open Source under the MIT license.&copy; Matt Kaczorowski 2016
